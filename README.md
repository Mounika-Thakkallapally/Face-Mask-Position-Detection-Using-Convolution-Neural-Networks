# Face-Mask-Position-Detection-Using-Convolution-Neural-Networks
This project is an end-to-end system designed using Convolutional neural networks. 
This system is developed in such a way that it can be integrated to any image capturing device which 
takes an input and processes it and gives an output with 96.52% accuracy saying whether the mask is worn properly or not.
